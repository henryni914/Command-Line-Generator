# Command-Line-Generator
## Description
The purpose of this generator is to allow a company to create a quick overview of employees through a series of prompts. In the overview the name, id, and  email will be displayed for all employees, regardless of their role. There are also role specific information that is added into the overview such as the office number for a manager, a github username for engineers, and the school that the intern attends.    
## Installation
To run this CLI program, the user will need to install the node packages jest and inquirer. Jest will be used to test the classes and to ensure that all are working by passing the tests. Inquirer will allow the prompts to run and allow the user to input relevant information to each prompt.
## Usage
To run the prompts, in the command line enter "node app.js" after installing all necessary packages.
